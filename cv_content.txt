Research Experience
Graduate Research Assistant, Computer Vision Lab, Chosun University                            Sep 2022–Present
– Explainability-Guided Optimization: Developed generative-gradient regularization to refine early-layer
  features, increasing feature variance and improving downstream accuracy across diverse backbones.
– Fingerprint PAD (Cross-Sensor/Material): Proposed sensor scaling, liveness-score guided local en-
  hancement, and receptive-field-wise error calculation to improve generalization and mitigate overfitting in
  low-data regimes.
– Efficient PAD Architectures: Designed attention-aggregated lightweight networks balancing accuracy
  and computational cost for edge deployment.
